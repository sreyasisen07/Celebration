<div class="card-header">What’s the difference between event design and event planning?</div>
<div class="card-body">Event design and event planning work hand in hand to deliver a successful event. Event design is about bringing your event to life with appropriate colours, themes, seating, etc, whereas event planning co-ordinates the logistic elements and budget management.

                       Events by Knight offer tailor made events. This means we incorporate both event design and event planning to create that perfect event.

<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">How do you keep budgets on track?</div>
<div class="card-body">We are meticulous about keeping track of everything we need to spend money on. This is done by constant monitoring and updating spreadsheets, knowing where to prioritise spending and keeping aside a budget to cater for emergency contingencies.</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">What factors do you consider when selecting a venue?</div>
<div class="card-body">We consider the size and capacity of venue needed for the number of guests, facilities provided, parking, technical needs and budget constraints. We visit venues to check on the quality of the facilities and liaise with clients, keeping them informed of decisions made.</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">How early do we need to start planning an event?</div>
<div class="card-body">Whilst this obviously depends on the size and nature of the event, we’d always advise you to start putting plans in place as early as possible. At certain times of year certain venues may need to be booked well in advance, as too with reputable suppliers and vendors. We advise handing over the reins to an event planner as soon as you’re aware of an event to be planned. This gives us adequate time to factor in back up plans as well as leaving ample time to negotiate, plan and ensure everything’s in place for your big day.</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">Can you cope with last minute changes of plan or emergency situations?</div>
<div class="card-body">We have extensive experience in dealing with the unexpected. We build in contingency measures for all our events and are constantly formulating plans to cope with emergency situations. Rest assured your event is always in the most capable hands.</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">What is your refund and cancellation policy?</div>
<div class="card-body">We’re aware that sometimes things happen which are outside of your control. In the event of needing a refund for a cancelled event, do discuss this with your event planner as early as possible, before extra services and products may have been ordered. We will discuss our policies with you before entering into contracts and then liaise with you in the unfortunate event of an event being canceled.

                       We believe it’s important that all parties are aware of their obligations and responsibilities. This goes a long way towards maintaining professionalism, enjoying healthy relationships with loyal vendors and suppliers and ensuring our customers are always delighted with our service to them.</div>
